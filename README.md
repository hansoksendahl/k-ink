# K-Ink

**K-Ink**: an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Command Line Interface (CLI)
Framework. ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è

## Overview

K-Ink isn‚Äôt just another CLI tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a modular framework for building
AI-powered tools and agents. Inspired by the vision of self-improving AI, K-Ink
provides a foundation for creating dynamic, adaptable workflows that evolve
alongside your needs. Whether you‚Äôre automating repetitive tasks, generating
tools on the fly, or designing entirely new capabilities, K-Ink empowers you to
harness the potential of AI agents with ease. It‚Äôs not just about solving
problems‚Äîit‚Äôs about building the systems that solve them.


## About This Repository

This repository was created to accompany the blog article about **K-Ink**, a
framework for creating AI-powered Command Line Interface (CLI) tools. After
building several AI-driven CLI tools, I identified a recurring abstract
pattern‚Äîa foundational technique that could be distilled into a reusable
framework for developing similar AGI agents.

**K-Ink** showcases this pattern in its simplest form, offering a minimal
reproduction of the core ideas. It serves as a starting point for developers who
want to create their own modular, self-improving AI tools. While this repository
focuses on the essentials, the techniques presented here have already been
applied successfully in more advanced tools currently in production.

If you‚Äôre curious about building AI-powered CLI tools or exploring the
possibilities of adaptable, self-evolving agents, this repository provides the
foundation you need to get started.

## Features

- **AI-Powered**: Let K-Ink generate, execute, and even rewrite code for you.
- **Extensible**: Use existing tools or create new ones dynamically within the
  CLI.
- **File and Directory Management**: Read, write, and manipulate your filesystem
  with ease.
- **Customizable**: Expand K-Ink‚Äôs capabilities by defining new tools to suit
  your needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before diving in, ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed. Then clone
this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
bun install
```

Set up your environment variables for API access:

```env
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Now you‚Äôre ready to unleash K-Ink.

## Usage

run k-ink by passing a message to guide its behavior:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "Describe your task here"
```

Example:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "Read a file named 'example.txt' and display its contents."
```

K-Ink interprets your message, uses its built-in tools, and executes the action.
No scripting required‚Äîjust plain language commands.

### Getting Help

Not sure what K-Ink is capable of? Don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîK-Ink is self-aware and can guide
you through its own functionality. Simply ask for help:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "help"
```

K-Ink will provide a rundown of the tasks it can handle and inspire you to
unleash its full potential.

## Built-in Tools

K-Ink comes equipped with powerful tools that form the foundation of its
functionality. Let‚Äôs explore them:

### File-Write Tool

The `file-write` tool lets K-Ink create or modify files on your filesystem.
Combine it with the `file-read` tool to build workflows that process and update
data.

#### Example Usage:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "Write 'Hello, world!' into a file called 'output.txt'."
```

---

### File-Read Tool

The `file-read` tool allows K-Ink to read the contents of a file on your local
filesystem. Use this to retrieve file data and pass it into your workflows.

#### Example Usage:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "Read the contents of 'example.txt'."
```

---

### Directory-Read Tool

The `directory-read` tool enables K-Ink to list the contents of a directory.
Perfect for inspecting files or preparing automated tasks across multiple files.

#### Example Usage:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "List all files in the 'src' directory."
```

---

## Extending K-Ink

K-Ink isn‚Äôt limited to its built-in tools‚Äîyou can extend its functionality by
creating new tools dynamically or by defining them directly in your codebase.

### Example: Creating a New Tool

One of the most powerful features of K-Ink is its ability to create new tools
dynamically. You can describe what you need in plain language, and K-Ink will
handle the rest‚Äîgenerating the code, updating the tools index, and integrating
the new functionality seamlessly.

Here‚Äôs an example of creating the `directory-read` tool, which lists the
contents of a directory. This is how the tool itself was originally created:

```shell
bun run k-ink -m "\
Read the tools in ./src/lib/langchain/tools and create a new tool called
directory-read that will read the contents of a directory. Update the exported
tools in ./src/lib/langchain/tools/index.ts"
```

Or define it manually by following the structure of the built-in tools. Once
defined, add it to the tools index for easy access:

```typescript
import fileRead from './file-read'
import fileWrite from './file-write'
import directoryRead from './directory-read'
// Add your new tools here

const tools = [fileRead, fileWrite, directoryRead /* , newTool */]

export default tools
```

## Why K-Ink?

K-Ink goes beyond being a simple tool‚Äîit‚Äôs an AI assistant that grows with you.
From file management to creating entirely new workflows, K-Ink empowers you to
offload tedious tasks and focus on the bigger picture. And with its
extensibility, there‚Äôs no limit to what you can build.
